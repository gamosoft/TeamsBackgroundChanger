# Teams Background Changer

## Introduction
This project started as a way to add animated backgrounds to **Microsoft Teams**. By default you cannot just pick a *.gif* file and use it directly, so after reading some posts like this one:

https://rogierdijkman.medium.com/microsoft-teams-animated-backgrounds-b457ee38d50d

I decided to create this silly app to update these backgrounds quickly.

To summarize, the process simply involves renaming your animated *.gif* file to *.png*, and uploading it together with a *thumbnail* copy to a specific **Teams** folder, so this is what the app does. ðŸ˜Ž

I have only tested it in Windows 10... the code *should* work for MacOS as well but haven't tested it.

I didn't find a way to automate the full process since I cannot figure out where the background image information is stored, so there's a little manual thing you have to do only once and that's it:

- In the settings file you'll find an entry for the image prefix (by default *background-changer*). This means that upon running the app it will create *background-changer.png* and *background-changer_thumb.png* files in the destination folder.

- Once you run the app for the first time, or if you do the process manually, simply open up your **Teams** application and choose this newly specified background.

From now on, every time you run the app it will replace *background-changer.** files with new ones, so will effectively change the wallpaper. Just run it before a new call and you'll be ok.

Also, if you're sharing your camera when running the app the process will not work; simply deactivate it and run it again.

As usual full source is provided so feel free to modify and do whatever you want with it.

## Installation
Just modify your *appsettings.json* file prior to executing the app.

```json
{
  "ImageConfig": {
    "TeamsImagePrefix": "background-changer",
    "SourceFolder": "C:\\teams-backgrounds",
    "SourceExtensions": [ ".gif", ".jpg", ".png" ]
  }
}
```

You should change these values:

- **TeamsImagePrefix**: The prefix of the image files that will be written to the Teams user backgrounds folder
- **SourceFolder**: A folder that contains images to be applied as backgrounds (animated or not)
- **SourceExtensions**: Collection of allowed image extensions to be processed. Most likely *gif* for animated backgrounds, but also *jpg* and *png* (basically whatever is supported by Teams OOB)

As mentioned, run the app once, then open up **Teams** and choose the newly setup background.

When you re-run the app, it will choose a different background and apply it.

## Context menu
Only for Windows, I have also created a registry file that allows you to set an image file as **Teams** background without having to open the settings menu, etc...

Just install the provided *teams-background-shell.reg* file by doucle-clicking on it, it's just a basic **Powershell** script that copies the files into the desired location. They are copied with the names *background-changer.png* and *background-changer_thumb.png* to be in sync with the above specified settings. If for some reason you want to change these names it's very easy to edit the *.reg* file and put whatever you want.

Onve you have it installed, just right-click on an image file and you'll see a popup like this one:

![Context menu](./context-menu.png "Context menu")

Same restrictions apply, that is, if you run it while sharing your camera it won't work.

Hope you enjoy it!
